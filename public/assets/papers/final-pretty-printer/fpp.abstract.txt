Widely-used pretty printing libraries are built on assumptions from a previous
age of computing that are no longer universally true, such as monospace fonts
and batch-mode compilers. Furthermore, they are not extensible, which has led
to a plethora of similar libraries. We demonstrate an approach to pretty
printing that is independently extensible and supports proportional fonts and
interactive interfaces.
