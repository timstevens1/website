Galois connections are a foundational tool for structuring abstraction in
semantics and their use lies at the heart of the theory of abstract
interpretation. Yet, mechanization of Galois connections has remained limited
to certain restricted modes of use, preventing their fully general application
in mechanized metatheory and certified programming.

This paper presents constructive Galois connections, a framework for Galois
connections that is effective both on paper and in proof assistants; is
complete with respect to the set of Galois connections with computational
content; and enables more general reasoning principles, including the
"calculational" style advocated by Cousot.

Crucial to our technical approach is the addition of monadic structure to
Galois connections to control a "specification effect." Effectful calculations
may reason classically, while pure calculations have extractable computational
content. Explicitly moving between the worlds of specification and
implementation is enabled by our metatheory.

To validate our approach, we provide two case studies in mechanizing existing
proofs from the literature: one uses calculational abstract interpretation to
design a static analyzer, the other forms a semantic basis for gradual typing.
Both mechanized proofs closely follow their original paper-and-pencil
counterparts, employ reasoning principles not captured by previous
mechanization approaches, support the extraction of verified algorithms, and
are novel.
