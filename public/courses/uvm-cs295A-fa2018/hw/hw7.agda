-- To submit the assignment, upload your solution to blackboard as a
-- single .agda file.
--
-- Make sure you write your name, the date, and your collaboration
-- statement above, as indicated by the course course collaboration
-- policy:
--
--     Collaboration on the high-level ideas and approach on
--     assignments is encouraged. Copying someone else's work is not
--     allowed. Any collaboration, even at a high level, must be
--     declared when you submit your assignment. Every assignment must
--     include a collaboration statement. E.g., "I discussed
--     high-level strategies for solving problem 2 and 5 with Alex."
--     Students caught copying work are eligible for immediate failure
--     of the course and disciplinary action by the University. All
--     academic integrity misconduct will be treated according to
--     UVM's Code of Academic Integrity.
--
-- This assignment consists of a LIB section which contains relevant
-- definitions and lemmas which you should refer to throughout the
-- assignment, and an ASSIGNMENT section which contains definitions
-- and lemmas with “holes” in them. *If you only change the code
-- within the holes and your entire assignment compiles without
-- errors, you are guaranteed 100% on the assignment.*
