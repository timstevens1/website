<h3>Course Description</h3>

<p>
This course will cover programming language-based techniques which apply to
software development, software verification, models of computation, and logical
foundations of mathematics. Related sub-topics include programming language
design, compiler implementation, program analysis, software security, and
higher-order logic. Course topics will be approached from the perspective of
type theory. Coursework is intended to be a 50/50 split between exercising
mathematical concepts and implementing algorithms.
</p>

<p>
Prerequisites: CS 124 and CS 125.

<em>Course announcements and discussion will take place on Piazza exclusively.</em>
</p>

<h3>Textbook</h3>

<p>
The textbook we will use for this course is <a
  href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/">Pierce's Types and
  Programming Languages</a>. It is highly recommended you obtain a personal
copy to use throughout the course. Homework problems will be drawn directly
from this textbook, and the exams will be open textbook in addition to only one
page of other notes.
</p>

<h3>Software Tools</h3>

<p>
<b>Programming Language:</b> Many of the assignments will have a programming
component. We will use the <a href="https://ocaml.org">OCaml</a> programming
language for these assignments. For the first assignment you will be required
to successfully set up and configure OCaml on either your personal machine or a
computer lab machine. We will use OCaml version 4.06.0 for the entirety of the
course.
</p>

<p><a href="/courses/uvm-cs225-sp2018/ocaml.html">Instructions for setting up OCaml</a></p>

<p>
<b>OCaml Resources:</b> 
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://ocaml.org/learn/tutorials/99problems.html">99 problems solved in OCaml</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Formal Writing:</b>
Many of the assignments will have a written mathematics component. If you want
to write your solutions on a computer, I recommend using the <a
href="https://www.latex-project.org">LaTeX</a> typesetting system.  However,
using LaTeX is not required.
</p>

<h3>Policies</h3>

<p>
<b>Grades:</b>
Your grade for the course will be calculated as follows: 60% Assignments (6
assignments at 10% each assignment), 20% Midterm Exam, and 20% Final Project.
The last assignment is a final project checkpont. In total, the final project
(checkpoint assignment + final submission) is 30% of your final grade. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Attendance:</b>
Attendance is not mandatory but will be rewarded. Attendance will be taken
every class. Students who miss no more three classes will receive an automatic
5% extra credit to their final grade. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Exams:</b>
There will be one midterm on March 08, and one final exam on May 03. Each exam
will be open textbook, meaning you may reference the Types and Programming
Languages text during exams. You will also be allowed one physical page (8 1/2"
x 11") of notes for each exam. There is no final exam, and this course will
conclude before the University's exam period.
</p>

<p>
<b>Late Work:</b>
Each assignment will typically be released on a Sunday night, and due a week
from the following Monday at 11:59pm. I will automatically grant a deadline
extension up to that Wednesday at 11:59pm. You do not need to email me or any
TAs to receive the extension---it is automatic. There is no penalty for
submitting work before Wednesday at 11:59pm. Work will not be accepted after
Wednesday at 11:59pm except in the case of personal emergencies. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Collaboration:</b>
Collaboration on the high-level ideas and approach on assignments is
encouraged. Copying someone else's work is not allowed. Any collaboration, even
at a high level, must be declared when you submit your assignment. Every
assignment must include a collaboration statement. E.g., "I discussed
high-level strategies for solving problem 2 and 5 with Alex." Students caught
copying work are eligible for immediate failure of the course and disciplinary
action by the University. All academic integrity misconduct will be treated
according to <a
  href="https://www.uvm.edu/policies/student/acadintegrity.pdf">UVM's Code of
  Academic Integrity</a>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Invited Talks:</b> 
I will give +1% extra credit to your final grade (~10 assignment points) for
each faculty candidate talk you attend. You must write 10-20 sentences about
what the candidate talked about, and what you found interesting about the
presentation. Specifically, you must include (1) the candidate's main research
result, and (2) the candidate's proposal for future research. I expect each
candidate will have slides indicating these points directly. If they don't, say
in your writeup that the speaker wasn't specific regarding these points. <em>
You must email me your writeup within 24 hours of the talk to receive
credit.</em> See the Piazza announcement for dates, times, locations, and talk
titles.

<h3>Small Group Assignments</h3>
<p>
For homework 4 and 5 only you will be allowed to work in groups of size 1–2
(independently or in pairs). You may submit a single solution to the
assignment, as well as a writeup of how the group arrived at the final
solution. There will be more detailed instructions about how to submit
groupwork in the assignment writeup.
</p>

<h3>Final Group Project</h3>
<p>
We will have a final project instead of a final exam. You will be allowed to
work in groups of size 1–4 for the final project, however I will expect a
larger amount of work to be completed as group size increases. There will be a
list of final project options along with small descriptions for you to choose
from, or you may propose your own. Here is a preliminary list of final project
topics:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Exceptions (e.g., as in Java or C++ exceptions) [only if not covered in HW4]</li>
  <li>Subtyping (e.g., as in Java or C++ classes)</li>
  <li>Recursive Types (e.g., as in Java or C++ recursive datatypes</li>
  <li>Dependent Types [challenging; not suitable for small groups]</li>
  <li>Information Flow Types (for security applications)</li>
  <li>Region Types (e.g., as in Rust typesafe memory lifetimes)</li>
  <li>Typed Assembly Language (for safe compilation)</li>
  <li>Gradual Types (e.g., as in Typed Javascript)</li>
  <li>Linear Types (for safe resource usage, e.g., file handles)</li>
  <li>Constraint Types (e.g., as in Haskell's Type Classes or Rust's Traits)</li>
  <li>Effect Types (e.g., a generalization of Java's checked exceptions)</li>
  <li>Modules (e.g., ML/OCaml modules)</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Soon I will post short descriptions for each project, as well as my expected
difficulty of each project. Group size need not match the difficulty of the
project, e.g., a large group could pick an "easy" topic, but I will expect much
more complete and detailed descriptions and implementations of the type
feature.
</p>
