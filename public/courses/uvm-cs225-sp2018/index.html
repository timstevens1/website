<h3>Course Description</h3>

<p>
This course will cover programming language-based techniques which apply to
software development, software verification, models of computation, and logical
foundations of mathematics. Related sub-topics include programming language
design, compiler implementation, program analysis, software security, and
higher-order logic. Course topics will be approached from the perspective of
type theory. Coursework is intended to be a 50/50 split between exercising
mathematical concepts and implementing algorithms.
</p>

<p>
Prerequisites: CS 124 and CS 125.
</p>

</p>

<h3>Textbook</h3>

<p>
The textbook we will use for this course is <a
  href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/">Pierce's Types and
  Programming Languages</a>. It is highly recommended you obtain a personal
copy to use throughout the course. Homework problems will be drawn directly
from this textbook, and the exams will be open textbook in addition to only one
page of other notes.
</p>

<h3>Software Tools</h3>

<p>
<b>Programming Language:</b> Many of the assignments will have a programming
component. We will use the <a href="https://ocaml.org">OCaml</a> programming
language for these assignments. For the first assignment you will be required
to successfully set up and configure OCaml on either your personal machine or a
computer lab machine. We will use OCaml version 4.06.0 for the entirety of the
course.
</p>

<p>
<b>OCaml Resources:</b> 
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://ocaml.org/learn/tutorials/99problems.html">99 problems solved in OCaml</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Formal Writing:</b> Many of the assignments will have a written mathematics
component. We will use the <a href="https://www.latex-project.org">LaTeX</a>
typesetting system. For the first assignment you will be required to
successfully set up and configure LaTeX on either your personal machine or a
computer lab machine.
</p>

<p>
<b>Version Control:</b> You will be required to use the <a
href="https://git-scm.com">Git</a> version control system. Assignments will be
submitted via your assigned Git repository.
</p>

<h3>Policies</h3>

<p>
<b>Grades:</b> Your grade for the course will be calculated as follows: 60%
Assignments, 20% Midterm Exam, and 20% Final Exam.
</p>

<p>
<b>Attendance:</b> Attendance is not mandatory but will be rewarded. Attendance
will be taken every class. Students who miss no more three classes will receive
an automatic 5% extra credit to their final grade. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Exams:</b> There will be one midterm on March 08, and one final exam on May
03. Each exam will be open textbook, meaning you may reference the Types and
Programming Languages text during exams. You will also be allowed one physical
page (8 1/2" x 11") of notes for each exam. The final exam will only cover
material covered after the first midterm, and is intended to be the same
difficulty as the midterm. The final exam will take place during the last
class, and this course will conclude before the University's exam period.
</p>

<p>
<b>Late Work:</b> Each assignment will be due on a Friday at 11:59pm. I will
automatically grant a deadline extension up to that Sunday at 11:59pm. You do
not need to email me or any TAs to receive the extension---it is automatic.
Work will not be accepted after Sunday at 11:59pm except in the case of
personal emergencies. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Collaboration:</b> Collaboration on the high-level ideas and approach on
assignments is encouraged. Copying someone else's work is not allowed. Any
collaboration, even at a high level, must be declared when you submit your
assignment. Every assignment must include a collaboration statement. E.g., "I
discussed high-level strategies for solving problem 2 and 5 with Alex."
Students caught copying work are eligible for immediate failure of the course
and disciplinary action by the University. All academic integrity misconduct
will be treated according to <a
href="https://www.uvm.edu/policies/student/acadintegrity.pdf">UVM's Code of
Academic Integrity</a>.
</p>
