<h2>Final Project</h2>

<p>
For the final project, you can either (1) choose one of the TAPL-based or
ATAPL-based projects described below, (2) choose a topic from the
non-book-based projects list (for which there is less details and material to
guide you along), or (3) invent your own project, pending approval from the
instructor. If you plan to invent your own project, I suggest submitting your
idea to me well before the deadline.
</p>

<p>
If you choose to invent your own project, I will be looking for the following criteria:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>It must exercise concepts and techniques covered in CS 225.</li>
  <li>There must be some reference material (e.g., a paper, book chapter, blog
    post, etc.) for me to look at, which you will base your project on. If no
    reference material exists, you can provide a more detailed sketch of the
    project goal in your proposal.</li>
  <li>The scope of the project must be achievable in the time you have to complete it.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Project descriptions <em>may be mixed and matched</em>, and I expect larger
groups to tackle either (i) a more challenging project topic, or (ii) a
combination of 2--3 less challenging project topics. Topics that are prefixed
with an asterisk (*) are topics which we have already covered in class, but
which you may combine with other project topics to enhance the difficulty.
E.g., Type Reconstruction can be combined with References for a slightly more
challenging project, or combined with Universal and/or Existential
Quantification for a moderately more challenging project.
</p>

<p>
There will be 5 deliverables for the project. <em>All deadlines are final with
  no extensions.</em>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Due Friday, April 20: 
    <a href="/courses/uvm-cs225-sp2018/final-project.html#proposal">Project Proposal</a></li>
  <li>Due Friday, April 27: Project Checkpoint</li>
  <li>Due Monday, April 30: Project Presentation Draft</li>
  <li>Tuesday May 01 and 03: Project Presentation</li>
  <li>Due Monday, May 07: Project Final Submission</li>
</ol>

<h3>Git</h3>
<p>
<em>You will be required to use Git for your final project.</em>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>If you do not already have a <a href="http://github.com">github</a>
    account, make one.</li>
  <li>On all of your written materials (including the proposal), include your
    github handle underneath your names. (See the example proposal doc.)</li>
  <li>All team members should be listed as collaborators for your project.</li>
  <li>You will be required to set up github pages for your project with a
    readme and links to code and materials.</li>
</ol>

<h3>LaTeX</h3>
<p>
<em>You will be required to use LaTeX for your final project.</em>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Install <a href="https://www.latex-project.org">LaTeX</a> on your
    personal machine if you haven't already. (This step may take a lot of time
    and/or disk space.)</li>
  <li>There are four documents you will need to produce: Proposal, Checkpoint,
    Draft Presentation, and Final Presentation. These must be typeset in LaTeX,
    however I will give you templates to work from.</li> 
</ol>

<h3>TAPL-based Projects</h3>

<h4>*References—TAPL Chapter 13</h4>
We saw references in class. This topic may not be chosen as the core topic for
a final project, but may be selected as an "add-on".
<h4>Exceptions—TAPL Chapter 14</h4>
For supporting functions which throw exceptions, and functions which
catch/handle exceptions. E.g., this technique will be similar to Java's checked
exceptions. An extra option for this topic is to encode exceptions using monads
(not covered in the book), implement exception semantics and typing using
monads, and then compare with the approach in the book.
<h4>Subtyping—TAPL Chapter 15</h4>
For supporting types which form a subtype hierarchy. E.g., this technique will
support record subtyping, which are similar to objects in object-oriented
languages.
<h4>Object-oriented Programming—TAPL Chapters 18 and 19</h4>
For supporting classes and objects. E.g., this technique will support
object-oriented concepts like super-classes, objects, and inheritance as found
in Java.
<h4>Recursive Types—TAPL Chapter 20</h4>
For supporting recursive data-structure. E.g., this technique will support defining
recursive datatypes like linked lists, as found in Java or OCaml.
<h4>Type Reconstruction—TAPL Chapter 22</h4>
For supporting type inference, which reduces the need to write type annotations
in programs. E.g., this technique will support powerful type inference as found
in OCaml.
<h4>*Univeral Quantification—TAPL Chapter 23</h4>
We saw universal quantification in class. This topic may not be chosen as the
core topic for a final project, but may be selected as an "add-on".
<h4>*Existential Quantification—TAPL Chapter 24</h4>
We saw existential quantification in class. This topic may not be chosen as the
core topic for a final project, but may be selected as an "add-on".
<h4>Bounded Quantification—TAPL Chapter 26</h4>
This topic is equivalent to combining Subtyping and Universal Quantification.
A benefit of choosing this topic is that the book dedicates an explicit chapter
for how to combine these features.
<h4>Higher-Order Polymorphism—TAPL Chapter 29</h4>
For supporting type operators and type-level computation. E.g., this technique
will support parameterized types like lists (in both Java and OCaml), and
provide the necessary machinery to typecheck complex instances of
data abstraction.
<h4>Higher-Order Subtyping—TAPL Chapter 31</h4>
This topic is equivalent to combining Subtyping and Higher-Order Polymorphism.
A benefit of choosing this topic is that the book dedicates an explicit chapter
for how to combine these features.
<h4>Purely Functional Objects—TAPL Chapter 32</h4>
This topic is an extension of the previous topic, but applied to object
oriented programming: classes, objects and inheritance.

<h3>ATAPL-based Projects</h3>

<h4>Linear Types—ATAPL Chapter 1</h4>
For supporting types which are "consumable". E.g., after a file is opened, it
must be closed, and after it is closed, it may not be used again. Linear types
support enforcing these types of invariants at the type level.
<h4>Dependent Types—ATAPL Chapter 2</h4>
For supporting types which depend on terms. This topic is a generalization of
Higher-Order Polymorphism as described in TAPL. E.g., the type of the sort
function might look like this:
<pre>
  sort : forall (n:nat), int_list n -&gt; int_list n
</pre>
which tracks at the type-level that the output list is the same length (n) as
the input list. 
<h4>Effect Types and Regions—ATAPL Chapter 3</h4>
For supporting the tracking of stack-allocated memory lifetimes. E.g., a
function may allocate memory on its stack for a value, and pass a reference to
that value to functions called within the body of the function. However, once
the function returns, the pointer is no longer valid, because the lifetime of
the stack frame has ended. Region types track these lifetimes at the type
level. Effect types and regions are one of the core typechecking mechanisms in
Rust, a programming language developed by Mozilla for developing efficient and
secure web browsers.
<h4>Typed Assembly Language—ATAPL Chapter 4</h4>
For supporting type-checking of assembly code which is generated by compiling a
more expressive, high-level language.
<h4>ML-Style Module Systems—ATAPL Chapter 8</h4>
For supporting modular data abstraction, linking, and separate compilation.
E.g., OCaml's advanced module system is based on these concepts.
<h4>Advanced Type Inference (HM(X))—ATAPL Chapter 10</h4>
For supporting more advanced type inference (i.e., type reconstruction), as
well as mechanisms for ad-hoc polymorphism. E.g., these concepts show up in
Haskell's type classes and Rust's traits.

<h3>Non-book-based Projects</h3>

<h4>Information Flow Types</h4>
Based on this <a
  href="http://users.cis.fiu.edu/~smithg/papers/jcs96.pdf">paper</a>. A
security-motivated type discipline which enforces that information about
confidential data (e.g., passwords) is not leaked to unauthorized channels
(e.g., an unauthorized user). The same mechanism can also apply to the dual
problem of data integrity, which enforces that untrusted data (e.g., user input
on an HTML form) does not influence high-integrity data (e.g., an internal SQL
query).

<h4>Gradual Types</h4>
Based on this <a
  href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/b7ca/4b0e6d3119aa341af73964dbe38d341061dd.pdf">paper</a>.
Gradual type systems aim to support the seamless integration of typed languages
with untyped languages, e.g., Javascript and a typed-dialect, or Ruby and a
typed-dialect. Gradual typing has seen a lot of attention from the
web-programming communities, e.g., at Microsoft, Facebook, Google, etc..

<h2>Final Project—Proposal</h2> 
</div>
<p>
<em>Due Friday, April 20, 11:59pm</em>
</p>

<p>
First, download the <a
  href="/courses/uvm-cs225-sp2018/resources/final-project-proposal.zip">example
  LaTeX project</a> and build the document. It should output a file
<code>main.pdf</code> after you run <code>make</code>
</p>

<p>
Form a group of 1–4 people, and select a project topic (or combination of
topics) from the final project webpage. In 2–4 pages, write a short
description of what you plan on accomplishing, and how you plan to accomplish
it.
</p>

<p>
Every member of your group must create a GitHub account. Select one member of
your group to create a new repository and add the other members of the group to
the repo as collaborators. In your writeup, you must write the github user
names of each member of your group, as well as the url to your project
repository.
<em>I should be able to build your writeup directly from your repository.</em>
</p>

<p>
Submit your proposal by emailing it to me (as .pdf) with "CS 225 Project
Proposal" in the subject line.
</p>
